# IMDB Movie Sentiment Analysis Project

This project investigates the correlation between user sentiment and specific movie characteristics using data from the Internet Movie Database (IMDB). The primary goal is to analyze user reviews and determine if specific movie attributes, such as genre, movie rating, and run length, are associated with more positive or negative sentiment.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into two main folders:

1.  **Deliverable Docs:** Contains the project deliverables in Markdown format. These documents provide detailed explanations of the project's goals, methodology, findings, and recommendations.
2.  **Code:** Contains the Jupyter Notebooks used for data analysis and machine learning model development. These notebooks provide the code and implementation details for the analyses described in the deliverables.

## Navigating the Project

### Deliverables

The `Deliverable Docs` folder contains the following deliverables:

*   **Final Project Deliverable 1:** Provides an overview of the project, including the problem definition, dataset selection, and reasoning.
*   **Final Project Deliverable 2:** Describes the data cleaning and preprocessing steps, descriptive statistics, and initial data visualizations.
*   **Final Project Deliverable 3:** Details the machine learning model development, evaluation, and recommendations based on the model's predictions.
*   **Final Project Milestone 4:** Presents further text analysis using word clouds and Named Entity Recognition (NER) to gain deeper insights into user sentiment.

### Code

The `Code` folder contains the following Jupyter Notebooks:

*   **Final_Project_Deliverable_1:** Contains the code for exploring the data I was considering using for this final project described in Deliverable 1. 
*   **Final_Project_Deliverable_2:** Contains the code for data cleaning, preprocessing, descriptive statistics, and data visualizations described in Deliverable 2.
*   **Final_Project_Deliverable_3:** Contains the code for machine learning model development, evaluation, and prediction generation described in Deliverable 3.
*   **Final_Project_Milestone_4:** Contains the code for text analysis using word clouds and NER described in Milestone 4.

## How to Use this Repository

1.  **Review the deliverables:** Start by reading the deliverables in the `docs` folder to understand the project's goals, methodology, and findings.
2.  **Explore the code:** Once you have a good understanding of the project, explore the Jupyter Notebooks in the `code` folder to see the implementation details.
3.  **Run the code:** If you have Jupyter Notebook installed, you can run the code yourself to reproduce the results and experiment with the data.

This repository provides a comprehensive overview of the IMDB Movie Sentiment Analysis project. By combining the information in the deliverables and the code, you can gain a deep understanding of the project's methodology and findings.
